# Ambient Audio Files

Place your processed ambient audio files here.

## Required Files

### `room-tone.mp3` (Primary)
- **Purpose**: Main ambient layer for gallery space
- **Emotional Texture**: Quiet presence of an empty gallery - subtle hum of air, ventilation, acoustic character of a large room
- **Duration**: 30s - 2min (seamless loop)
- **Volume**: Very subtle (8% base, 12% in scene 2)

## Optional Files

### `air-texture.mp3`
- **Purpose**: Additional layer for scene 2 ("Enter the quiet")
- **Emotional Texture**: Almost imperceptible air movement - gentle breeze through corridor, subtle pressure changes
- **Duration**: 30s - 2min (seamless loop)

### `deep-drone.mp3`
- **Purpose**: Optional atmospheric layer
- **Emotional Texture**: Slow evolving pad - distant rumble, low-frequency resonance
- **Duration**: 1-3min (evolving, not looping)

## File Requirements

- **Format**: MP3, 160kbps, 44.1kHz
- **Normalization**: -16 LUFS or quieter
- **Fades**: 2-second fade in, 2-second fade out
- **Loop**: Seamless, no clicks at boundaries
- **License**: CC0 or royalty-free for commercial use

## Quick Setup

1. See `AUDIO_SOURCES.md` for download sources
2. See `QUICK_START.md` for processing instructions
3. Use `scripts/process-audio.sh` to process files

## What to Avoid

- Music with rhythm or melody
- Vocals or spoken words
- Nature sounds (birds, water, traffic)
- Sudden volume changes
- High-pitched or harsh frequencies
- Audio that draws attention

**The goal**: Presence, not performance. Silence that breathes. Atmosphere, not soundtrack.
