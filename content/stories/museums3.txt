== The book is going good. Though it was boring in between but now you are in a flow and suddenly it’s 1 AM. You are not just reading but you are floating. You jump from word to word. You catch your breath at a comma and you take a nap at a full stop. Your eyes are tired. The burden of decipline is heavy and irritating. You must sleep. Will you be able to experience the same reading riot next morning? ==
