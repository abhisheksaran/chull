== room: laughter ==

We laughed at the frivolous thought for hours. The walls reverberated with our smiles; the ceiling held its stomach. It was pained. Lungs tried hard to fill with air before the next burst. There wasn't anything funny in particular. The room next to us might have heard the sinful tales and been annoyed. What they lacked was the intention to laugh. What we had was a symphony—that is, once you do start laughing, everything is a laughingstock. You merely notice the content. What you notice is the absurdity of it all—the duality of randomness and certainty. Which one you choose to believe decides whether you will live a pessimistic life or have a heart that gets high on laughter. The morality as we know it in its popular form could be altered and joked about, still not being judged as evil in those moments. Humbled, we took to the roads. Tea in the morning was bad. The invention of milk powder is useless. The roadside tea tastes a thousand times better.
