== I laugh a lot. Even when the joke is not that funny. Because I am the laughter. The ability to be joyous. To be able to laugh at little things. Look at little things. Such as the sprouting of that chilly we planted a week earlier. Such as that beautiful colour of paste made of tomato and curd- the baby pink, how beautiful, I thought. Such as those two last lost buttons on the check shirt. Finally, when a trailer fixed it, I wore it for three days in a row. I guess I missed the feeling of that shirt. Remember the little things. Life is not made of grandeur. It's made of the tiniest of things we overlook.
