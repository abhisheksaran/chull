I sat in quiet, letting myself drown in the boredom, staring at the bare white ceiling, wondering how long can I hold my breath. The evening felt slightly colder than usual. I desired to read, to swim, maybe in an attempt to find a balance between boredom and excitement. To set the mood for it, first, I must shed the effects of visual entertainment. I thought a shower would do me good, if not completely then at least for the next few hours, and ran to the bathroom. When you are alone in your flat, you don't have to worry about carrying anything with you inside, and I didn't. I kept pouring water on my head for minutes. It ran through my back and down to my legs. The water was freezing. A new wave of goosebumps with each pour turned me more interested in the senses it evoked. When I came out, I was shivering. I put on my jacket after drying myself with a towel, grabbed my book from beside my bed, came out in the hall, turned on the light above the cupboard. I sat there in the quiet again, with the smell of lilies placed in front of me in a vase on the bookshelf, which was originally intended to be a television shelf, beside that a ukulele, which also didn't fulfill the purpose it was bought for. I kept feeling cold. I went inside my room, brought the comforter, wrapped it around my legs, and opened the page where I left it the last time, while trying to recall the story so far. When I got tired of sitting, with my eyes heavy and exhausted, I drank some water, and I got up and started walking in the hall.
