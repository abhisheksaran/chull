== Here! Take this, it's a seed I swallow 
Every day
Hoping, one day
A lily flower would grow in me
If I dance in the rain ==
== July 20th, 2025 Window==

The sound of the cloud bursting in your belly 
Are you hungry? 
Or are you thirsty
Of a good poem in my voice?

The stars collide in the sky 
I see them in your eyes
And then I see a smile
And then laughter in your earlobes 

The children run to their homes after school 
From the window in my room
Just before the rain
I saw myself running towards the balcony 

The clothes have been drying there
For the last three days 
Climb down the staircase 
To change the pillow case
Please!

Don't be afraid, here, touch the water
The mountains are in your mind 
The ocean in your palms 
The rivers in your veins

Here! Take this, it's a seed I swallow 
Every day
Hoping, one day
A lily flower would grow in me
If I dance in the rain
