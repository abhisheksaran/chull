I look at the the map, it read 2 kilometres in 20 minutes by walk. It rained and I took refuge under a big tree, branches of which have withnessed generations like us come and go, soaring amidst the city’s irregular heartbeat. The wind came and swayed the branches, the resting drops on its leaves fell down, fell hard on me, and died against the heat of my body. A standalone simple filter coffee shop, as if hiding from big nicely coloured cafes and from their warm lights, captured my attention, and made me stop, to have a sip. A house around the corner named- “The Turning Point”- looked like a castle of a prince, most probably a half-man because it had just one storey.
