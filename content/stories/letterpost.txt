== From the small window in my bedroom
I heard the whisper 
The giggling of the tree
With it the wind that blushed 
The dogs barked
A motorcycle honked on the main road
Then there was utter silence 
I woke up and opened my eyes
There was nothing on the wall
But there was still a tree 
And wind 
And a dance  ==

A letter post around the corner 
Locked
A memory card in the drawer
Dusty 

He said, remember me
The way earth remembers gravity 
Run your fingers swiftly over my picture
The way clouds disappear in the sky
 
I wish there was another traffic light, asking
Do you really want to go?
A cop catching you, asking
Why are you over-speeding?

The ancient house 
Where we grew 
Is locked 


There was a shadow of the tree 
On my bedroom wall
I stared at it 
Not the shadow, but the light around it




When the shadow of the tree 
Swinging, and dancing 
Appeared on my wall as I tried to sleep

His hands were on the waist of the wind
The wind that leaned on and touched the leaves 

From the small window in my bedroom
I heard the whisper 
The giggling of the tree
With it the wind that blushed 
The dogs barked
A motorcycle honked on the main road
Then there was utter silence 
I woke up and opened my eyes
There was nothing on the wall
But there was still a tree 
And wind 
And a dance 



In that silence 
The sound of your anklets in my courtyard
