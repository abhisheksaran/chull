Theodor washed his face, made a mild coffee to delay the drowsiness for four hours—the drowsiness he was experiencing while laying down on the floor, across the window, the place he has chosen after a careful consideration and multiple tries of various orientation, outside which it rained, some droplets of which made their way with the wind and landed on his naked chest— how pleasant, he told himself. 

He has decided to finish reading this book with 80 pages remaining, the one that makes you feel like punching the writer— only mental pleasure he could subject himself to at this hour of sun setting after a suntained exertion of twelve hours— on-call, as they call it in his professional lingo, to ease his eyes and refill his brain with pictures of some far away land, people, tales, and torture; how pleasant, he told himself again.
