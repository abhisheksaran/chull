There on the bare ground he spreads his arms and legs turning in some kind of star. Clearly a decaying star. The cold dampness of the floor seeps in through his calves, his back, and his arms covered in dust. The life as he knows, start slipping out of his hand. First, the movement. He tries to get up with all his might. The neurons gives in. The light goes out. He wishes for one more day to sit in the sunlight. He knows it won’t be granted. Then the eyes, they lose the sense of image, eagles hover above in a clear sky. Then comes the memory- sixty years of his life in a moment will come to an end. The movie his eyes made, sleeping or awake, will be lost for forever. A loss from which universe could never recover but it isn’t bothered about remembering any of us. 

This wasn’t a particular day he would have chosen to die if he had any control. When we woke up today morning, he didn’t know that beauty will cease to exist after today. He sees eagles hovering above the trees in the clear sky. The memories of As if that’s how it might feel. A death for which no one wails and cries. Merely any leaf fall on the ground.
