== There on the night full of darkness, the yellow road lights moving his shadow in a circle, his ankles moving in a circle, the circle of slow pain, and a song playing on his headphones—they were all yellow, i came along, i wrote a song for you, and it was called “yellow”==

The leg which pushes the paddles down comes back crying and shouts to the other one- harder, and the paddels crack, but he doesn’t hear a thing, though he feels it, a muscle cracking, a stinging pain, a confused brain: what to listen? The song which is playing in the headphones or the crying glutes or the agonised quads or he could have avoided all of it hadn’t he made the romantic decision to cycle for workout earlier—an unusual thought when he looked at the dusty bicycle and held its handles. It isn’t fair, though, to only blame the sight of a dusty bicycle, for whatever emotion—guilt or aftection—it caused, equally, it was the cool breeze which cut his face as he stepped out of the lift; to feel alive is to let the breeze cut through the face, and to let it bleed freely, he thought. There on the night full of darkness, the yellow road lights moving his shadow in a circle, his ankles moving in a circle, the circle of slow pain, and a song playing on his headphones—they were all yellow, i came along, i wrote a song for you, and it was called “yellow”—he wrote a story in his mind, the story of dark shadows, yellow lights, and the cold breeze, and the cold play. How it all relates, he later thought, is because he thinks obsessively about it all—a cracked brain, whose lid you aren't able to close. The new song, the robbers 1975, gets played, with it changes all the thoughts; after many more songs he manages to reach back from home, his pride contended, his legs wounded inside, nevertheless he has lived, all of it: pain and pleasure.
