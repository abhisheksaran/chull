Dear Ila,
Life is very busy these days. I woke up and realised I don't have to go to work today. My back was sore. So I treated myself with the foam roller. I needed bananas for my breakfast. I didn't order online today. I got out and took a walk. It's been a long time since I walked in the morning. The tailor shop at the corner was open. The barbershop next to it too but the seat in front of the mirror was empty. There are too many people and everyone wants barber to come to their house for haircut. I got to a grocery shop further on the main road. I looked around at the people waiting at the red light. A woman crossed the road meanwhile, in a hurry though. A car came and parked in front of the pet hospital. A young couple emerged out of the badminton arena, sweating all over. Their wet hair stuck to their forehead. I looked on the other side of the road, the shutter of driving school on the second floor was down. Life is busy. Very busy. 
I strolled around and came to a halt at a cart, a woman selling coconut water on the footpath. She said forty rupees when I asked how much. Nothing has changed. At least not the price of coconut water. The one stop bus fare is now six instead of five though. But the buses are same- old and rusty. The people in it same- young and chirpy. 
Dear Ila, why don't you have an affair, sometimes an affair saves a marriage. There are so many young boys out willing to take out a married woman on a nice date. The other day I overheard someone in the gym gossiping about a married woman in their society who even got kids. When my wife died, I was in the office giving a presentation. My kids nowadays ask me to go on dates. They even made an online profile for me. I don't know what to say to strange women.
